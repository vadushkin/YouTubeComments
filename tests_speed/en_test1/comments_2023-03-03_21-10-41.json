    "cjdunn": "Very nice video Cy! Those otters are so much fun I got mine a few weeks ago, I had the luck of getting to talk to PP and seeing if they still had some left which they did! The single chamber does make it a lot easier to inflate, apart from my tiger which has 6 chambers (videos up on my channel). I'm going to have to make a video of my otter eventually. He and my tigress are accompanying me to MFF this year so they can mingle with the other squeakies! Lol",
